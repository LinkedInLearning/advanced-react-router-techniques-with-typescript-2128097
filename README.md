## Course Description

In this course, Oluchukwu Okpala, a senior SE, guides you through advanced React Router techniques to elevate your navigation skills and build scalable applications. Learn about nested routes, dynamic parameters, programmatic navigation, and seamless error handling. Discover how to implement protected routes for securing parts of your app and manage navigation without full-page reloads. Use React.lazy and React Suspense to optimize performance through lazy loading. Understand the intricacies of client-side routing, and navigate through different route structures efficiently. By the end of this course, you will be able to confidently build user flows, handle dynamic data, and ensure excellent user experiences in your apps.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
